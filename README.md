# FastAPI Wallet Authentication

fastapi-walletauth provides a simple way to authenticate users in FastAPI applications using a wallet.
It currently supports Ethereum and Solana wallets/signatures.

## Installation

```shell
pip install fastapi-walletauth
```

## Usage

Adding the authentication endpoints is as simple as importing the `authorization_routes` from `fastapi_walletauth`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_walletauth import authorization_routes

app = FastAPI()

app.include_router(authorization_routes)
```

This will add the following endpoints to your application:

- `POST /authentication/challenge`: Returns a challenge for the user to sign
- `POST /authentication/solve`: Returns a Bearer token if the signature is valid
- `POST /authentication/logout`: Invalidates the current token
- `POST /authentication/refresh`: Returns a new token if the current token is valid

You can then use `WalletAuthDep` to protect your endpoints:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_walletauth import WalletAuthDep, authorization_routes

app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(authorization_routes)

@app.get("/protected")
def protected(wa: WalletAuthDep):
    return wa.address
```

## Signing the challenge

The challenge is a serialized JSON object containing the following fields:

```python
message = {
    "chain": "ETH",
    "address": "0x...",
    "app": "myapp",
    "time": 1688819493.8691394
}
```

**PLEASE NOTE**: The `app` field needs to be set to the name of your application. This is used to prevent replay attacks.
```shell
export FASTAPI_WALLETAUTH_APP=myapp
```

The signature format depends on the wallet type and is specified in the `chain` field. This signature is then sent to the
`/authentication/solve` endpoint to obtain a Bearer token.
